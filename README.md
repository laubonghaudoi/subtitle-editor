# subtitle-editor.org

## Design principles

- Permanently free and open-source under MIT license
- Fully web-based, no download or installation required
- No account signup or login required, edit subtitles directly in the landing page
- Front-end only with zero backend, thus fully extensible and can be plugged in to a custom backend
- Minimalist UX

I talked about my design principles in the [FAQ](https://subtitle-editor.org/faq) and [this issue](https://github.com/laubonghaudoi/subtitle-editor/issues/11#issuecomment-3201949429).

### Features

- Multi-track editing
- Waveform visualization
- Localization
- .srt / .vtt format support

### Tech stacks

- NextJS 15 + React 19
- shadcn + radix-ui + Tailwind CSS
- wavesurfer.js
- react-player
- Tabler icons
- Motion

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laufei/subtitle-editor.git
cd subtitle-editor
npm install
# Run the development server with Turbopack.
npm run dev
# Create a production build and type-check.
npm run build
# Serve the pre-built app.
npm run start
```

### Project Structure

- `app/` – Next.js 15 routing, including the localized editor in `app/[locale]/` and static pages such as `app/faq`.
- `components/` – UI building blocks, with `components/ui/` holding shadcn-based primitives and domain widgets like `subtitle-list.tsx`.
- `context/` – Global state, including the undoable subtitle store.
- `hooks/` – Reusable client hooks (`use-undoable-state`, toast helpers).
- `lib/` – Pure utilities for parsing SRT/VTT, time conversions, and locale helpers.
- `messages/` – Per-locale translation catalogs consumed by `next-intl`.
- `tests/` – Node-based unit tests plus fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`.
- `public/` – Static assets (icons, favicons, etc.).

### Testing

```bash
npm test                # Run the entire suite
npm test -- parse-vtt.test.ts  # Focus on a single file
```

Tests rely on Node’s built-in `node:test` runner and cover parsing, time conversions, and multi-track behavior. Add fixtures under `tests/fixtures/` when validating new subtitle edge cases.

## Progressive Web App

- Installable manifest lives at `public/manifest.json` with icons in `public/icons/`.
- Service worker is generated by `next-pwa`; run `npm run build && npm run start` to test install/offline flows (it is disabled in `npm run dev`).
- Navigating to `/offline` shows the cached fallback view used when requests fail.
- Editor state persists in `localStorage`, so subtitle tracks survive refreshes while offline; clear browser data to reset.

## Internationalization

Locales are configured in `lib/locales.ts`. Add new locales by extending the `locales` array, providing metadata, creating a `messages/<locale>.json` file, and translating keys surfaced in `app/[locale]/page.tsx`. Middleware routes traffic based on locale prefixes while defaulting to English.

## Contributing

I will check issues and accept PRs regularly, but I am quite busy these days so I may not have time to develop new features. This is a community project and your contributions are always welcomed!
