        Yes I know, there are many subtitle editors out there. But I found that
        none of them is ideal for me so I built this one. Below are the editors
        that I have tried and what I think are missing in them:

          offers a free online subtitle editor. No account registration is
          required. Editing subtitles and previewing with the video is very
          easy. It is the closest to what I need. Unfortunately, it's missing
          waveform visualization, which is deal breaker for me. It is not open
          sourced either and we can't customize it.

          is a great option and has all features I need. It supports waveform
          visualization, easy preview and editing, and even AI transcriptions.
          But it is a desktop software which requires installation, and it
          doesn't support Mac. I have to use a Windows or Linux device to edit
          subtitles.

          is similar to Subtitle Edit. It is a desktop software suitable for
          more complex subtitle editing. Also I found waveform visualizer not
          very intuitive. (Btw these desktop softwares have 1990s-style UI which
          really demoralizes me)

          are either too complex and feature-bloated, or are not free.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None of them is open-sourced, and the UIs are either too ugly or too
        complex, which really bothers my subtitle editing experience. What I
        want is an editor that is:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal mx-6 my-2">
        <li>Permanently free</li>

        I need an AI transcriber / srt generator, any recommendations?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Yes I recommend generating the srt file with an AI transcriber first,
        then editing it with this editor. That's why I listed "AI
        transcriptions" as a non-goal above. It's much easier to just use a
        specialized tool for that than building it into this editor. There are
        many free srt generators available on huggingface, such as:
